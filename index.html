				<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Tumbleweed-64</strong>, or T64 for short. I'm a Seattle-based developer who makes some various cool projects.
				I know about 8 languages reasonably well, including C-family languages such as C++, scripting languages like Bash and Python, and
				web languages like HTML, because how else would I write this page you're reading? SquareSpace? What kind of idiot would do that?</p>
				<p>Anyway, you can click the links below to view some of my projects, as well as descriptions of some that I'm currently developing 
				(or want to but I'm too busy at the moment).</p>
